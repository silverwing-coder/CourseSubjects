<h4>Prerequisites: Not Appliclible</h4>
<h4>Course description:</h4>
This course is designed for students with little programming knowledge and experience to prepare for more advanced programming courses. It covers elementary concepts and skills of computer programming and provides a foundation or learning additional aspects of programming by demonstrating problem-solving techniques and program design methodologies using C/C++. Topics include fundamentals of computer systems and programming, selection and iteration controls, functions, arrays, basic computer terminology, and software evelopment principles. C programming language will be introduced and touched on to explain the basics of computer programming during lectures. Students are required to use C/C++ in programming lab classes and course assignments.
