<p>//***** <br/>
This page is created to provide instructions to setup aerial drone programming on <a href="https://docs.px4.io/main/en/">PX4" Autopilot</a>. <p>
<ul>
    <li>Python interpreter version was downgraded to 3.8 in order to make the python packages (pymavlink, mavsdk, and dronekit) compatitable with PX4 programming</li>
    <li>Tested compatibility with MAVProxy, Mission Planner, and QGroundControl</li>
    <li>SITL tested with QGroundControl, PX4-Autopilot, Gazebo Simulator on WSL (Ubuntu) environment</li>
</ul>

<br/><h3>1. S500 Drone Kit Assembly</h3>
<ul>
    <li>This is required to finish on student's group work. There are numerous tutorals and guidances on the Web. Most useful references will be the YouTube tutorials that provide step by step demonstration. <br/>--> Refer to the PPT silde on Canvas for CIS 463 course</br></li>
    <li>After assembliing the drone kit finished, perform calibration with a Ground Control Station; Mission Planner or QGroundContro, and perform flight test with a RC Transmitter Controller located in the Lab Cabinet. </li>
</ul>
