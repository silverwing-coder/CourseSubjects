<h3>Course Description</h3>
<p>This course is a research-oriented, practical project program which provides students with a fundamental knowledge of programming for robotics, aerial vehicle operations, and competencies in building an aerial or ground vehicle. Throughout this course, a group research project will be executed with 2~3 students in each group.  We will cover microcomputer/microcontroller programming for an aerial or ground vehicle and its component devices on computer vision, machine learning, and computer network APIs. Students will utilize lab supplies of a robot assembly kit, single board micro-computer, micro-controller, different electronic sensors, and networking devices.</p>

<h3>Course Outlines</h3>
<p>Upon successful completion of this course, the students will be able to</p>
<ul>
<li>Construct and operate an aerial vehicle while understanding its systems, operations, and legal constraints.</li>
<li>Develop a program for aerial and ground vehicles utilizing open-source APIs and micro-UAV communication interfaces.</li>
<li>Construct a data streaming server/client application for the remote control of the aerial and ground robots over IP/Wi-Fi network.</li>
<li>Utilize open-source machine learning models and techniques based on computer vision to implement object detection and tracking systems.</li>
<li>Employ inter-process communication, multi-processing, and multi-threading technologies to implement the construction of independent communication channels.</li>
<li>Design basic 3-D model using CAD tools and produce the model with a 3-D printer.</li>
</ul>
